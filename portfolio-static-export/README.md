### What Doesn't Work (Static Version):
- **Contact form submission** (needs backend server)
- Form will show but won't actually send emails
- To make contact form work, you need the full-stack deployment

## 🔧 Making Contact Form Work

If you want a working contact form, you have these options:

1. **Deploy Full Stack** (recommended)
   - Use the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for free hosting
   - Frontend + Backend + Database integration

2. **Add Form Service**
   - Use Formspree, Netlify Forms, or similar
   - Replace form action in HTML

3. **Email Integration**
   - Add mailto: links for direct email
